### Project  Preview
In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

This data set contains the following features:

- ___'Daily Time Spent on Site'___: consumer time on site in minutes
- ___'Age'___: cutomer age in years
- ___'Area Income'___: Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
- ___'Daily Internet Usage'___: Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
- ___'Ad Topic Line'___: Headline of the advertisement
- ___'City'___: City of consumer
- ___'Male'___: Whether or not consumer was male
- ___'Country'___: Country of consumer
- ___'Timestamp'___: Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
- ___'Clicked on Ad'___: 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad


### Project Objectives:

- Prepare a detailed python notebook using Logistic Regression for predicting based on several input characteristics
Visualize the dataset.
- Plot graphs between various features to establish trends in data.
- Split up the data between training and testing set accordingly.
- Train the Logistic Regression Model on "training" set.
- Evaluate the Model on "testing" set. Print 
- classification report and model's accuracy.
